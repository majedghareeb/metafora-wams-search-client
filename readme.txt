Searches selected post types after a user types, displaying results below field.

== Description ==

A custom field for Gravity Forms that will search any selected post types as the user types into the field and show the results below the field. Set which post types, how many results, and customize the display format of the results. Lots of unique CSS classes included for full custom styling!

This plugin was created as a way to help customers find documentation articles before submitting a support ticket. The goal is to reduce the number of support tickets submitted by helping customers find and answer themselves. Maybe you can find other uses as well!
